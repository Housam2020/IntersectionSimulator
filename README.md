# IntersectionSimulator
Self-driving intersection simulator for Engineering Design course.


This code is used to simulate an intersection in the City of Hamilton and show how traffic congesntion can be improved using self-driving car technology. 
It was used to improve the throughput of our design by 50% and run tests to prove the feasability of our design. 
The tests were then used to present the results to a panel of experts.

Uses objects, inheritance, constructors, for loops, while loop, among other tool learned in the introduction to coding course as well as many Design patterns such as factory for the cars and lanes.
