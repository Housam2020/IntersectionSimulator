# IntersectionSimulator
Self-driving intersection simulator for Engineering Design course


This code is used to simulate a self-driving intersection to be deployed in a city to improve traffic congesntion. 
It was used to improve the throughput of our design by 50% and run tests to prove the feasability of our design. 
The tests were then used to present the results to a panel of experts.

Uses objects, inheritance, constructors, for loops, while loop, among other tool learned in the introduction to coding course as well as many Design patterns such as factory for the cars and lanes.
